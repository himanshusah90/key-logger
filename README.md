A keylogger, short for "keystroke logger," is a type of surveillance software used in cybersecurity that records every keystroke made on a keyboard. This tool can capture everything typed on the computer, including passwords, messages, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information.

Types of Keyloggers:

1) Hardware Keyloggers: These are physical devices attached to the keyboard or computer that capture keystrokes. They can be USB devices or built directly into the keyboard or even the computer's hardware.

2) Software Keyloggers: These are programs installed on a computer that log keystrokes. They can run in the background, often undetected by the user.

   Uses of Keyloggers:
-Malicious Intent: Cybercriminals use keyloggers to steal sensitive information like passwords, bank details, and personal data. This data can then be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to systems.

-Monitoring: In some cases, keyloggers are used by employers to monitor employee activity, or by parents to track their children's computer usage. However, this raises ethical concerns about privacy.
